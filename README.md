This project is based on the "Natural Language Processing in Python Tutorial" given by PyOhio. I really don't have any experience with any field in data science, let alone natural language processing (or let alone Python lol). The concepts covered in the tutorial were quite new and interesting to me, so I decided to conduct a project on my own and to further dive into some concepts proposed in the tutorial. 

# 1. Frequently used terms

> **(Written) Corpus**: a large map of texts. For example, mapping from an author (key) to his transcript. (value)

> **Document Term Matrix**: Word counts in a matrix (also a map), where columns are words and rows are documents (for example different books from different authors). Sometimes referred as term-document matrix as well, which is a transposed form of the DTM.

> **Stop-words:** Words which do not necessarily contain information of important significance to NLP. They are often words like (like, as, be, the, this etc.)

> Stems/ Roots/ Lemmas

# 2. Pythonists are obsessed with packages!

## 2.1. Pulling data
1. bs4 (Beautiful soup) - parses data from HTML and XMLs; probably only useful if I'm scraping information from sites.
2. requests - for pulling data from sites; not useful at the moment.

## 2.2. Storing data
1. pickle - keep python objects in an actual file (`.pkl`) for further use.
2. pandas - data frames or databases for storing data.
3. defaultdics in collections - easier for processing maps of data

## 2.3. Linguistic tools
1. `gensim` (matutils and models) - topic modelling by taking a corpus and a number of topics
2. TextBlob in `textblob` - for determining sentiment and polarity of words within a text.
3. `nltk` (or Natural Language Toolkit) - a powerful tool developed by linguists at UPenn, it tags words with categories (nonun, adjectives and much more), and allows tokenization of long strings.
4. sklearn.feature_extraction (`text` and `countvectoriser`) - used for converting the data to a document term matrix, and various options for filtering actually "useful" words or phrases.
5. `re` - great for recognising common text expressions.
6. `strings` - for manipulating string objects
7. WorldCloud in `wordcloud` - for generating topical wordclouds.
8. `random` - for random text generation (sort of allows you to create an infinite map/ web)

## 2.4. Mathematical tools
1.  `matplotlib` - for plotting graphs!
2.  `numpy` - offers other types of plots like bar plots, and even subplots.
3.  `math` - duh!
4.  `seaborn` (based on matplotlib) - a more highlevel interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphs. Support for examining relationships, categorial variables, univariate or vibariate distributions, regression, multiplot grids, more options for visualisation and appearance.
5.  `plotly.py` - beautiful charts, licensed by MIT.
6.  `bokeh` - GUI for creating highly customed or specialised plots

# 3. Extensions

These are slightly more advanced techniques that may be considered throughout my project.

## 3.1. TF-IDF or Term Frequency Inverse Data Frequency
- Term frequency (tf): frequency of word ( in each document) in the corpus. Ratio of term frequency to total word count.  
  $tf_{i,j} = \frac{n_{i,j}}{\sum_{k} n_{i,j}}$
- Inverse Data Frequency (idf):  used to calculate the weight of rare words across (all documents in) the corpus. Words that rarely occur in the corpus have a high IDF score.  
$idf(w) = log(\frac{N}{df_t})$
- TF-IDF is the product of tf and idf:  
$w_{i,j} = tf_{i,j} \times idf(w)$

- Notation
  - $tf_{i,j}$ = number of occurences of i in j
  - $df_i$ = number of documents containing i
  - N = total number of documents

> Implementation suggestion: `TfidFVectorizer` from `sklearn.feature_extraction.text`.

## 3.2. Text normalisation: Stemming and lemmatisation (‚úîÔ∏è)

When a language contains words that are derived from another (root) word , the changes are called **Inflected Language**. For example, modifications are made to reflect tense, case, aspect, person, number, gender and mood or position in speech. For example, googling fish (I use DuckDuckGo) will also result in fishes, fishing as fish is the stem of both words.

Stemming and lemmatisation both helps us to achieve or obtain the root form of inflected words, but their approach in obtaining the root forms of words are different.

For English, there are 2 different stemmers available for `nltk`, including  PorterStammer or LancasterStammer.

### 3.2.1. Stemming (‚úîÔ∏è)
> Stemming is the process of reducing inflection in words to their root forms such as mapping a group of words to the same stem even if the stem itself is not a valid word in the Language.

Stem (or root) is the part of the word to which you add inflectional affixes such as (-ed,-ize, -s,-de,mis). So stemming a word may result in words that do not exist. Stems are created by removing the inflections used with a word.

    Word                Porter Stemmer      Lancaster Stemmer   
    friend              friend              friend              
    friendship          friendship          friend              
    friends             friend              friend              
    friendships         friendship          friend              
    stabil              stabil              stabl               
    destabilize         destabil            dest                
    misunderstanding    misunderstand       misunderstand       
    railroad            railroad            railroad            
    moonlight           moonlight           moonlight           
    football            footbal             footbal   

In gneral, PortStemmer is simpler and faster as it applies a fixed set og rules in phases to generate stems. `SnowballStemmers` can bs used to create non-English stemmers. In comparison, the LancasterStemmer applies an iterative algorithm, by saving  the last character of the word and applying changes according to 120 rules; it is prone to over-stemming, and may lead to stem words that are not linguistically correct.

### 3.2.2. Lematisation (‚úîÔ∏è)

> Lemmatization reduces the inflected words properly, ensuring that the root word belongs to the language. In Lemmatization the root word is called a Lemma. A lemma (plural lemmas or lemmata) is the canonical form, dictionary form, or citation form of a set of words.

You need to provide the context in which you want to lemmatize, that is the parts-of-speech (verb, noun, adjective......). This is done by giving the value for pos parameter in `wordnet_lemmatizer.lemmatize`.

    for word in sentence_words:
        print ("{0:20}{1:20}".format(word,wordnet_lemmatizer.lemmatize(word, pos="v")))

**Useful tools in nltk**
- Stemmers: PortStemmer and LancasterStemmer
- Tokenize words
- Tagging words with part of speech.
- Check out NLTK Text Corpora for free corpuses derived from e-books, web and news documents, by `nltk.download()`
- Stop-words removal (and union your own list of stop-words)

## 3.3. spaCy (‚úîÔ∏è)
spaCy offers various "industrial-strength" features for natural language processing Python:
- Non-destructive tokenization, sentence segmentation
- Named entity recognition and entity linking
- Tag with parts of speech
- Labelled dependency parsing: extracting a dependency parse of a sentence that represents its grammatical structure and defines the relationships between ‚Äúhead‚Äù words and words, which modify those heads. For example, identifying the subjects, conjucatons, modifications, case, determinant
- Neural networking
- Statistical models and Pretrained word vectors - provide information about definitions of words; available in a lookup table, and each word only has one representation regardless of context
- Language model pretraining - contextualised word representations- `spacy pretrain` trains a language model to predict each word's word vector based on surrounding words.
  - Rule based training
  - Bootstrap first set of training example texts
  - Train with annotations 
- (Most importantly), integration with deep learning.

## 3.4. Naive Bayes Classification using scikit-learn

Naive Bayes is a statistical classification one of the simplest supervised learning algorithms. It is  fast, accurate and reliable for large datasets.

> It assumes that the effect of a particular feature in a class is independent of other features. 

For example, a loan applicant is desirable or not depending on his/her income, previous loan and transaction history, age, and location. Even if these features are interdependent, these features are still considered independently. This assumption simplifies computation, and that's why it is considered as **naive**. This assumption is called **class conditional independence**.

$P(h|D) = \frac{P(D|h) \times P(h)}{P(D)}$  

Notation:
- P(h) = probability of hypothesis being true regardless of the data) - A.K.A. prior probability of h.
- P(D) = probability of the data (regardless of the hypothesis)
- P(h|D) = probability of hypothesis h given the data D - A.K.A. posterior probability.
- P(D|h) = the probability of data d given that the hypothesis h was true - A.K.A. posterior probability.

**Steps**  
Step 1: Calculate the prior probability for given class labels  
Step 2: Find Likelihood probability with each attribute for each class  
Step 3: Put these value in Bayes Formula and calculate posterior probability.  
Step 4: See which class has a higher probability, given the input belongs to the higher probability class.  

![naivebayes](naive_bayes.bmp)

> Implementation: `from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB`

**Disadvantages**
- Assumption of independent features (its almost impossible)
- Zwero posterior probability


## 3.5. More ideas!
- Text mining: text categorization, text clustering, concept/entity extraction, production of granular taxonomies, sentiment analysis, document summarization, and entity relation modeling (i.e., learning relations between named entities
- Query Expansion in Information Retrieval (IR) Environments
- Document clustering: normally performed after techniques including tokenization, stemming and lemmatisation, removing stop words (and punctuation), tf-idf
- Latent Semantix Indexing: "adding contextually-relevant/ thematically-related keywords or synonyms" by analysing relationships between two documents and terms they contain, to create a matrix out of large text. This is how Google predicts what your further searches will be.
- Non-negative matrix factorisation
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and Deep Learning



# 4. Outlook

This outlook will be continuously updated as I progress through various stages of the project. I imagine I would frequently return to the exploratory data analysis and sentiment analysis stages so as to increase the precision of topic-modelling and to improve the correctedness of sentences randomly generated. If time permits, I will also implement techniques mentioned in the "extensions" section.

## 4.1. Data Cleaning 
> Data cleaning helps avoid "garbage in , garbage out" -- we do not want to feed meaningless data into a model which will probably return us with more meaningless junk.

This time I will skip the scraping part that data scientists normally do. This allows the content to be updated over time, but to be fair the content is pretty static anyways so I don't really see the point of doing so. In addition, I imagine there would be quite a number of problems if the layout of the site changes.

### 4.1.1. Outline for data cleaning (‚úîÔ∏è)
- Input: a simple text file with metadata removed. Headers and page numbers are kept though.
- Common Pre-processing/ cleaning procedures
  - All lower case
  - Remove punctuation, symbols and numerical values
  - Remove common non-sensical text (such as line breakers `\n`)
  - Tokenize text: split sentences into individual words (in preparation for DTM)
  - Remove stop-words
  - Using NLTK perform stemming and lemmatisation for words in the DTM, to reduce the number of inflicted words.
  - Parts of speech tagging
  - DTM for bi-grams/ tri-grams (phrases like thank you)
- Output
  - Corpus: not much different from the actual input since there is only one file here....... but with all the data cleaned up.
  - Document Term matrix: a matrix of word counts in the entire corpus.

SpaCy can also perform these NLTK techniques as well, with a greater degree of efficiency. The extra features might be overkill for the time being though.


## 4.2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Before applying any fancy algorithms, the next step is to simply explore whether the processed corpuses and DTMs make sense.

When working with numerical data, some EDA techniques we can use include finding the mean, median or mode as well as the distribution of a data set. 

For text, we are going to find some more **obvious** patterns with EDA before identifying the hidden patterns with machines learning (ML) techniques. Relatively obious things are:

1. **Most common words** - find these and create word clouds
2. **Size of vocabulary** - look number of unique words

### 4.2.1. Procedures for EDA
1. With the DTM from the previous stage, sort into columns according to ascending order in value (of occurence)
2. Aggregate (or filter) data - select columns with the largest values.
3. Visualise top words - word clouds? bar charts?
4. Insights - a written comment/ description of the key takeaways.
5. Probably also try using TF-IDF (Term frequency - inverse data frequency) for better understanding the "uniqueness" or the "value" of the the vocabulary in the text.


## 4.3. Sentiment Analysis

**Input:** Both the corpus and document matrix generated will not be useful because they are in a bag of words format. But in sentiment analysis, order does matter, so the original text with non-sensical text removed should be analysed. (e.g. "great" vs "not great")

**Output:** Sentiment score (how positive/ negative they are) and a subjective score (how opionated they are).

### 4.3.1. Introducing TextBlob for Sentiment Analysis
1. **TextBlob Module:** Linguistic researchers have labeled the sentiment of words based on their domain expertise. Sentiment of words can vary based on where it is in a sentence. The TextBlob module allows us to take advantage of these labels.
2. **Sentiment Labels:** Each word in a corpus is labeled in terms of polarity and subjectivity (there are more labels as well, but we're going to ignore them for now). A corpus' sentiment is the average of these.
   * **Polarity**: How positive or negative a word is. -1 is very negative. +1 is very positive.
   * **Subjectivity**: How subjective, or opinionated a word is. 0 is fact. +1 is very much an opinion.
3. Can explpore change in sentiment over time (how positive or negative things get at different parts of the text)

More information on the [sentiment function](https://planspace.org/20150607-textblob_sentiment/).

TextBlob finds all the words and phrases that it can assign a polarity and subjectivity to, and takes the average. Not necessarily sophisticated, but it is a good rules-based implementation. Naive Bayes is a good statistical method but it assumes that all the variables are independent (?).


## 4.4. Topic Modelling

The aim of topic modelling is to find the various topics that are present in the corpus. One sepcific topic modelling technique is calledd Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which is specifically designed for NLP. This part is the most difficult in the sense that the results obtained can be quite arbitrary depending on the parameters passed in.

> LDA (hidden, type of probability distribution): "This document contains a probability distribution of these topics. A topic is a probability distribution of a certain subset of words."

**Inputs:** A document-term matrix - order doesn't matter, and number of topics to be generated

**Output:** A list of themes, to be interpreted by myself - does it make sense? Should I try altering the number of topics, the document-term matrix itself (only filtering nouns or adjectives), or the model for distribution?

### 4.4.1. Gensim to the rescue!
- Goal : want LDA to learn the topic mix in each document, and the word mix in each topic
- Input: Document term matrix, number of topics, number of iterations
    1. Choose the number of topics that you identify in your corpus
    2. Randomly assign each word in each document to one of the n topics.
    3. Go through every word and its topic assignment in each document. Look at:
        1. How often the topic occurs in the document; and,
        2. How often the word occurs in the topic overall. 
- Based on this information, it assigns the word a new topic. It goes through multiple iterations, and after several iterations that make sense and can be interpreted. It takes a while to find the best word distribution for each topic and best topic distribution for each document
- Output: top words in each topic
- This is a probabilistic approach to topic modelling. There are matrix factorisation techniques (latent semantic indexing, negative matrix factorisation) that are are better for numbers. LDA is essentially singular value decomposition for text.

## 4.5. Text Generation

- **Input:** a corpus, order matters
- **Output:** generate random sentences in the style of the author..... sounds pretty far-fetched?

This procedure completing text generation is relatively easy, but the quality is certainly correlated with the precision of topics interpreted in the previous stage, as well as the quality of initial data cleaning.

> Markov chains represent how systems change over time. The main concept behind Markov chains are that they are memoryless, meaning that the next state of a process only depends on the previous state.

From a dictionary perspective of the DTM, this means that the keys are the current words, and the values are simply list of words for the next state, or  pointers to the list of next words.

Markov chains can be used for very basic text generation. Think about every word in a corpus as a state. We can make a simple assumption that the next word is only dependent on the previous word - which is the basic assumption of a Markov chain.

**Things to learn**:
- Deep learning
- Long short-term memory (LSTM)

Both techniques acocount for the previous words, but also words before previous words, and the words that have already been generated.
