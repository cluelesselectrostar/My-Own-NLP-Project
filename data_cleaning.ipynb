     "text": "The Reader of Books It’s a funny thing about mothers and fathers. Even when their own child is the most disgusting little blister you could ever imagine, they still think that he or she is wonderful. Some parents go further. They become so blinded by adoration they manage to convince themselves their child has qualities of genius. Well, there is nothing very wrong with all this. It’s the way of the world. It is only when the parents begin telling us about the brilliance of their own revolting off¬ spring, that we start shouting, 'Bring us a basin! We’re going to be sick!’ 3 School teachers suffer a good deal from having to listen to this sort of twaddle from proud parents, but they usually get their own back when the time comes to write the end-of-term reports. If I were a teacher I would cook up some real scorchers for the children of doting parents. ‘Your son Maximilian,’ I would write, ‘is a total wash-out. I hope you have a family business you can push him into when he leaves school because he sure as heck won’t get a job anywhere else.’ Or if I were feeling lyrical that day, 1 might write, ‘It is a curious truth that grasshoppers have their hearing- organs in the sides of the abdomen. Your daughter Vanessa, judging by what she’s learnt this term, has no hearing-organs at all.’ 4  I might even delve deeper into natural history and say, ‘The periodical cicada spends six years as a grub underground, and no more than six days as a free creature of sunlight and air. Your son Wilfred has spent six years as a grub in this school and we are still waiting for him to emerge from the chrysalis. 5 A particularly poisonous little girl might sting me into saying, ‘Fiona has the same glacial beauty as an iceberg, but unlike the iceberg she has absolutely nothing below the surface. 5 I think I might enjoy writing end-of-term reports for the stinkers in my class. But enough of that. We have to get on. 5  Occasionally one conies across parents who take the opposite line, who show no interest at all in their children, and these of course are far worse than the doting ones. Mr and Mrs Wormwood were two such parents. They had a son called Michael and a 1 /> daughter called Matilda, and the parents . , O looked upon Matilda in particular as Of ^ ^ K, nothin? more than a scab. A scab is some- Vas A thing you have to put up with until the time comes when you can pick it off and flick it away. Mr and Mrs Wormwood looked forward enormously to the time when they could pick their little daughter off and flick her away, preferably into the next county 7 or even further than that. It is bad enough when parents treat ordinary children as though they were scabs and bunions, but it becomes somehow a lot worse when the child in question is extra- ordinary, and by that I mean sensitive and brilliant. Matilda was both of these things, but above all she was brilliant. Her mind was so nimble and she was so quick to learn that her ability should have been obvious even to the most half¬ witted of parents. But Mr and Mrs Wormwood were both so gormless and so wrapped up in their own silly little lives that they failed to notice anything unusual about their daughter. To tell the truth, I doubt they would have noticed had she crawled into the house with a broken leg. 6  Matilda’s brother Michael was a perfectly normal boy, but the sister, as I said, was something to make your eyes pop. By the age of one and a half her speech was perfect and she knew as many words as most grown-ups. The parents, instead of applauding her, called her a noisy chatterbox and told her sharply that small girls should be seen and not heard. By the time she was three , Matilda had taught herself to read by studying newspapers and magazines that lay around the house. At the age of four , she could read fast and well and she naturally began hankering after books. The only book in the whole of this enlightened household was something called Easy Cooking belonging to her mother, and when she had relief this from cover to cover and had learnt all the recipes by heart, she decided she wanted something more interesting. 7  'Daddy,’ she said, ‘do you think you could buy me a book?’ ‘A book ?’ he said. ‘What d’you want a flaming book for?’ ‘To read, Daddy.’ ‘What’s wrong with the telly, for heaven’s sake? We’ve got a lovely telly with a twelve-inch screen and now you come asking for a book! You’re getting spoiled, my girl!’ Nearly every weekday afternoon Matilda was left alone in the house. Her brother (five years older than her) went to school. Her father went to work and her mother went out playing bingo in a towm eight miles away. Mrs Wormw r ood was hooked on bingo and played it five afternoons a week. On the afternoon of the day when her father had refused to buy her a book, Matilda set out all by herself to walk to the public library in the village.-When she arrived, she introduced herself to the librarian, Mrs Phelps. She asked if she might sit aw r hile and read a book. \n"

Now, home to the feast!’They grabbed their jars of cider and off they went. MrFox was in front, the Smallest Fox came next andBadger last. Along the tunnel they flew . . . past theturning that led to Bunce’s Mighty Storehouse . . . pastBoggis’s Chicken House Number One and then up thelong home stretch towards the place where they knewMrs Fox would be waiting.‘Keep it up, my darlings!’ shouted Mr Fox. ‘We’ll soonbe there! Think what’s waiting for us at the other end!And just think what we’re bringing home with us inthese jars! That ought to cheer up poor Mrs Fox.’ MrFox sang a little song as he ran:‘Home again swiftly I glide,Back to my beautiful bride.She’ll not feel so rottenAs soon as she’s gottenSome cider inside her inside.’Then Badger joined in:48\\x0c‘Oh poor Mrs Badger, he cried,So hungry she very near died.But she’ll not feel so hollowIf only she’ll swallowSome cider inside her inside.’They were still singing as they rounded the final cornerand burst in upon the most wonderful and amazingsight any of them had ever seen. The feast was justbeginning. A large dining-room had been hollowed outof the earth, and in the middle of it, seated around ahuge table, were no less than twenty-nine animals.They were:Mrs Fox and three Small Foxes.Mrs Badger and three Small Badgers.Mole and Mrs Mole and four Small Moles.Rabbit and Mrs Rabbit and five Small Rabbits.49\\x0cWeasel and Mrs Weasel and six Small Weasels.The table was covered with chickens and ducks andgeese and hams and bacon, and everyone was tuckinginto the lovely food.‘My darling!’ cried Mrs Fox, jumping up and hugging MrFox. ‘We couldn’t wait! Please forgive us!’ Then shehugged the Smallest Fox of all, and Mrs Badger huggedBadger, and everyone hugged everyone else. Amidshouts of joy, the great jars of cider were placed uponthe table, and Mr Fox and Badger and the Smallest Foxsat down with the others.You must remember no one had eaten a thing forseveral days. They were ravenous. So for a while therewas no conversation at all. There was only the sound ofcrunching and chewing as the animals attacked thesucculent food.At last, Badger stood up. He raised his glass of ciderand called out, ‘A toast! I want you all to stand and drinka toast to our dear friend who has saved our lives thisday – Mr Fox!’‘To Mr Fox!’ they all shouted, standing up and raisingtheir glasses. ‘To Mr Fox! Long may he live!’Then Mrs Fox got shyly to her feet and said, ‘I don’twant to make a speech. I just want to say one thing,and it is this: MY HUSBAND IS A FANTASTIC FOX.’50\\x0cEveryone clapped and cheered. Then Mr Fox himselfstood up.‘This delicious meal . . .’ he began, then he stopped. Inthe silence that followed, he let fly a tremendous belch.There was laughter and more clapping. ‘This deliciousmeal, my friends,’ he went on, ‘is by courtesy of MessrsBoggis, Bunce and Bean.’ (More cheering andlaughter.) ‘And I hope you have enjoyed it as much as Ihave.’ He let fly another colossal belch.‘Better out than in,’ said Badger.‘Thank you,’ said Mr Fox, grinning hugely. ‘But now, myfriends, let us be serious. Let us think of tomorrow andthe next day and the days after that. If we go out, wewill be killed. Right?’‘Right!’ they shouted.‘We’ll be shot before we’ve gone a yard,’ said Badger.‘Ex-actly,’ said Mr Fox. ‘But whowants to go out,anyway; let me ask you that? We are all diggers, everyone of us. We hate the outside. The outside is full ofenemies. We only go out because we have to, to getfood for our families. But now, my friends, we have anentirely new set-up. We have a safe tunnel leading tothree of the finest stores in the world!’‘We do indeed!’ said Badger. ‘I’ve seen ’em!’51\\x0c‘And you know what this means?’ said Mr Fox. ‘Itmeans that none of us need ever go out into the openagain!’There was a buzz of excitement around the table.‘I therefore invite you all,’ Mr Fox went on, ‘to stay herewith me for ever.’‘For ever!’ they cried. ‘My goodness! How marvellous!’And Rabbit said to Mrs Rabbit, ‘My dear, just think!We’re never going to be shot at again in our lives!’‘We will make,’ said Mr Fox, ‘a little undergroundvillage, with streets and houses on each side –separate houses for Badgers and Moles and Rabbitsand Weasels and Foxes. And every day I will goshopping for you all. And every day we will eat likekings.’The cheering that followed this speech went on formany minutes.52\\x0cOutside the fox’s hole, Boggis and Bunce and Bean satbeside their tents with their guns on their laps. It wasbeginning to rain. Water was trickling down the necks ofthe three men and into their shoes.‘He won’t stay down there much longer now,’ Boggissaid.‘The brute must be famished,’ Bunce said.‘That’s right,’ Bean said. ‘He’ll be making a dash for itany moment. Keep your guns handy.’They sat there by the hole, waiting for the fox to comeout.And so far as I know, they are still waiting.53\\x0c'"
